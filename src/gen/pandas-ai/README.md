# Pandas AI: The Generative AI Python Library
In the age of AI, many of our tasks have been automated especially after the launch of ChatGPT. One such tool that uses the power of ChatGPT to ease data manipulation task in Python is PandasAI. It leverages the power of ChatGPT to generate Python code and executes it. The output of the generated code is returned. Pandas AI helps performing tasks involving pandas library without explicitly writing lines of code.

# What is Pandas AI
Using generative AI models from OpenAI, Pandas AI is a pandas library addition. With simply a text prompt, you can produce insights from your dataframe. It utilises the OpenAI-developed text-to-query generative AI. The preparation of the data for analysis is a labor-intensive process for data scientists and analysts. Now they can carry on with their data analysis. Data experts may now leverage many of the methods and techniques they have studied to cut down on the time needed for data preparation thanks to Pandas AI. PandasAI should be used in conjunction with Pandas, not as a substitute for Pandas. Instead of having to manually traverse the dataset and react to inquiries about it, you can ask PandasAI these questions, and it will provide you answers in the form of Pandas DataFrames. Pandas AI wants to make it possible for you to visually communicate with a machine that will then deliver the desired results rather than having to program the work yourself. To do this, it uses the OpenAI GPT API to generate the code using Pandas library in Python and run this code in the background. The results are then returned which can be saved inside a variable.
