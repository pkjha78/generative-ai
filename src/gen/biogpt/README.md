# Preparing a Dataset for Fine-Tuning Foundation Model

1. Dataset Collection

    - Sources: Gather data from pathology lab reports, medical journals, and any other relevant medical documents.

    - Format: Ensure that the data is in a readable format like CSV, JSON, or text files.

2. Data Preprocessing

    - Cleaning: Remove any irrelevant data, correct typos, and handle missing values.

    - Formatting: Convert the data into a format suitable for fine-tuning, usually pairs of input and output texts.

    - Example Format:

    - Input: "Patient exhibits symptoms of hyperglycemia."

    - Output: "Hyperglycemia"

3. Tokenization

    - Tokenize the text using the tokenizer that corresponds to the model you intend to fine-tune.
